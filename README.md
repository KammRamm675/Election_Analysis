# Whoâ€™s Who in the Election


## Overview of Project

### Purpose
-	The purpose of this analysis is to provide candidates and other authorized personnel the ability to see the results of an election audit for the election between the candidates Charles Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Doane.  This analysis also provides an in depth look of the voter turnout for each county involved, percentage of votes from each county, which county had the highest participation, and the election audit results. Also, included with this analysis is a "how-to" guide on how the script can be used in future endeavors with two examples. 

## Analysis and Coding

### Analysis of the counties and voters that participated

-     First, it should be noted there were only three (3) counties involved in this election.  These were Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson counties. Below is the total number of votes for each county with their respective percentages. NOTE - the same results can be displayed via this link (https://github.com/KammRamm675/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/election_analysis.txt)
     
     - Arapahoe County - 24,801 voters representing 6.7% of total voters present.
     - Denver County - 306,055 voters representing 82.8% of total voters present.
     - Jefferson County - 38,855 voters representing 10.5% of total voters present.
          NOTE - Total number of participating voters equaled 369,711 voters.
          

### Analysis of Election Candidates

-     There were three (3) participants in this election, Charles Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Doane. The following information is regarding each candidates votes and percentages that were received. 
      
     - Charles Stockham - received 85,213 votes representing 23.0% of total present.
     - Diana DeGette - received 272,892 votes representing 73.8% of total present.
     - Raymon Doane - received 11,606 votes representing 3.1% of total present.
          NOTE - Total number of participating voters equaled 369,711 voters. 
          NOTE - Percentages do not equal 100% due to the above percentages being valued to the tenths place.  If percentages were valued to the hundredths, all numbers line up.

## Results of the Election

## Election Audit Summary

### How to Use the Script for Future Elections.  
  
#### Adding Candidates 
  - This is very simple.  Simply go to the excel file used for the script and replace names.  If there more than three (3) this is also simple to fix because the script is not limited to just three (3) candidates.  The only thing you must be careful of is making sure the new candidate's name is in the appropriate column.  Adding a new name will be automatically tracked and votes related to the new name are also tracked. 
  
#### Adding A New County
  - Just like with adding a new candidate name, adding a new county is no different.  Just be sure to add the new county name to the appropriate column and all new counties will be tracked and counted appropriately and most importantly accurately. 

FINAL NOTE - ANY BALLOT ID, COUNTY NAME, AND CANDIDATE NAME (AS LONG AS ITS PLACED IN THE APPROPRIATE COLUMN) WILL BE TRACKED ACCURATELY WITHOUT CHANGE TO THE SCRIPT/CODE. TO ENSURE COMPLETE WORK, INPUT MUST INCLUDE BALLOT ID, COUNTY NAME, AND CANDIDATE NAME.  MISSING ANY PIECE WILL CREATE AN INACCURATE READING IN THE DISPLAY.
